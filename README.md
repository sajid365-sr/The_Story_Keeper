# Welcome to my Project.

This project was created by `Sajid Sorker`.

## Project Category: Old book selling website.
## Website Name: (The Story Keeper).
## LiveWebsite Link: `https://the-story-keeper-a3fc5.web.app/`

## Some Features

`1`  It's my first full-stack website with the implementation of the front end, backend, server, and with live payment method.

`2` The main feature and most interesting is the Stripe payment method. I've implemented stripe card payment on this website.

`3` Another important thing is the admin dashboard setup. This website has three types of dashboards one for the Admin, one for the seller, and one for the buyer.

`4` The Admin can see all buyers and all sellers. Also can delete any buyer and seller. The buyer can buy a product or make a product as a wish list item. Can see them on the dashboard. The seller can add a new book for selling and monitor their status on the seller dashboard.

`5` New type of error element is set up for this project which RouterError [https://reactrouter.com/en/main/route/error-element] from React Router.

`6` You can upload images from your device on this website using images. Either your user photo update or add a new book to sell.

`7`  Another important thing was to hide sensitive code like firebase config and mongoDB user and password, stripe payment secret, and JWT also. So I've to implement environment variables on both the client and server sides.

`8` This project was created by using React and also used react-router. So, you can easily access one page to another within a moment.

`9`  I've used Tailwind here as a CSS Library and use daisyUi and also a tiny amount of Flowbite as a CSS plugin.
